- First uses the pytorch alexnet model to generate the output feature maps of every layer as golden, so that cross-validation can be performed when coding out SystemC code.

# Problem faced
- I dont have prior knowledege of Neural Network, thus the main focus of this HW seems to focus on understanding and implementing the AlexNet model from scratch, not understanding the SystemC model.

- At first we do not know the parameters info of each layer, we must try it out first in pytorch model so that correct layer parameters can be found. One of the most annoying part of this HW is the first convolution layer and the average pooling layer. In order to get the correct result for the first layer, one must first pad the image from 224x224 to 227x227 which is an assymetrical zero-padding, this is annoying as xxx. We do not have this info when first implementing the AlexNet python model, which results in a hell lot of time. Then the adaptive average pooling 2d layer should be removed for getting the correct inference value, it seems like the average layer does not do anything when doing the inferences.

# Comment
- I think I still dont understand systemC at all after this HW, I dont think it is an appropriate topic for learning SystemC, since SystemC is a Transaction level hardware description language, which introduce lots of hazard when implementing AlexNet.
